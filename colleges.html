                <h4>OSU Cascades</h4>

                <p class="course-desc-2">I want to go to OSU since their engineering programs are pretty amazing. I do know that happens in the valley and I would be willing to move their if I got into contact with the professors there. I would try out classes here in Bend first and then see if I want to make the move. The main reason is that the research here isn't engineering focused. In the research tab <a style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline;" href="https://osucascades.edu/research-and-scholarship" target="_blank">here</a> there are three research opportunities. The websites show a lot of different information, so a move to the valley might be best. I checked out the Industry and Partners section which is something I look for in a college. I want to get educated and also have an opportunity to meet private sector leaders.</p>

                <h4>OIT</h4>
                <img style="display:block;margin:2% auto;margin-bottom:4%;" src="images/oit.jpg">
                <p class="course-desc-2">My first choice is OIT since I am going into Cybersecurity. OSU is a real option if I want to be a cybersecurity engineer, but I have been leaning towards being a pentester. I coded websites for about three years, and it got to a level of numbness from looking at code day in and out. I found that I like working with technology more than creating it. OIT is another amazing college, and they have the Cybersecurity Center there. I could finish up there and from what I heard the professors do a great job at helping you find work after graduating.
                <br>
                Wow, I just Googled OIT to <a style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline;" href=”https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/cybersecurity”>look at their</a> BS and graduate programs, and they now have a BS in cybersecurity as of Fall of this year (2019). I didn’t know they would be that good of a fit, I was planning on getting their BS in IT online degree.</p>
